# Credit Score Prediction Project

## Introduction:
This project focuses on predicting credit scores for individuals based on various financial and personal attributes. The dataset used for this project contains information such as annual income, monthly in-hand salary, number of bank accounts, credit card details, loan history, and more. The goal is to build machine learning models that can accurately predict credit scores, which are crucial for assessing an individual's creditworthiness.

## Data Exploration:
The initial step involves exploring the dataset to understand the distribution of credit scores across different attributes. Visualizations such as box plots are utilized to analyze credit scores based on occupation, income, monthly salary, number of bank accounts, credit card usage, loan history, and other factors.

## Preprocessing:
Before building machine learning models, preprocessing steps are performed. This includes handling missing values by filling them with mean values, scaling numerical features using StandardScaler, and encoding categorical features where necessary.

## Model Building:
Two machine learning models are employed for credit score prediction: Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the models are trained on the training set.

## Model Evaluation:
The performance of each model is evaluated using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly predict credit scores across different classes.

## Usage:
Once the models are trained and evaluated, they can be utilized to predict credit scores for new individuals. Users can input their financial and personal information, and the models will provide predictions for their credit scores.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in predicting credit scores based on individual attributes. By accurately assessing creditworthiness, financial institutions can make informed decisions regarding lending practices, thereby mitigating risks and promoting responsible lending.

## Technologies Used:
Python
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn
Future Improvements:
Explore additional machine learning algorithms for credit score prediction.
Fine-tune model hyperparameters to improve performance.
Gather more diverse and extensive datasets for better model generalization.
